Todo 1.0

A reimplementation of [megtodo](https://github.com/enocom/megtodo), this time using ActiveRecord.

This marks the completion of our MVP. 

Now, the fun begins...


Installation
------------

Run ```bundle``` first! Then, migrate the database with:

```
rake db:migrate
rake db:populate
```

and VOILA!! A populated, working database to test on!
